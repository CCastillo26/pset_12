# PHP 1560 - Week 12/13 Lab

This repository implements a pipeline to recommend how many bikes to place at a station at the start of a day using bike-share data. The script `estimation.R` reads in the data and estimates hourly arrival rates at each station ($\lambda(t)$). `simulation.R` uses these estimated rates to simulate a day of arrivals from a non-homogeneous Poisson process (oversimulated with $\text{Exp}(\lambda_{max})$ and thinned with probabilities $p_i = \lambda(t_i)/\lambda_{max}$) and then simulates bike use to record which trips succeed or fail. `placement.R` summarizes the simulated day with per-station metrics (failed trips and unused bikes) and produces a table with recommended bike numbers by station ID. `utils.R` can be used or adapted to run for different fleet sizes, such as 100, 200, and 500 bikes. Lastly, toy unit tests for the main functions are in `test.R`, and outputs are saved in the `Results/` folder.
